# TicTacTokki
An interactive New Jeans-themed Tic-Tac-Toe Game created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Game Overview: The code showcases a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players, "X" and "O," take alternate turns in aiming to place their marks on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all cells are filled without either player achieving a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.

Set-up Instructions: 
- Open Visual Studio Code for editing and running the project.

- Set up the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files within the folder in Visual Studio Code.
